# BERT-Embeddings-to-minimize-Bias
When the Conversation AI team first built toxicity models, they found that the models incorrectly learned to associate the names of frequently attacked identities with toxicity. Models predicted a high likelihood of toxicity for comments containing those identities (e.g. "gay"), even when those comments were not actually toxic (such as "I am a gay woman"). This happens because training data was pulled from available sources where unfortunately, certain identities are overwhelmingly referred to in offensive ways. Training a model from data with these imbalances risks simply mirroring those biases back to users.
